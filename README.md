# About me

I am an 19 year old game programmer currently getting a bachelors degree in game development at Gaming Campus in Paris. My strong love and passion for video games drives me to create interactive and fun experiences for players.

The past 2 years of game development allowed me to learn many different things such as game design, game programming, engine programming, multithreading, computer graphics and more. I also have experience with both Unity and Unreal Engine, and my programming language of choice is C++.

I am a native French speaker, with limited professional fluency in English, as well as some basics in Japanese.
